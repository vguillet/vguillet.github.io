            I am a French student currently completing a <b>MSc degree in Aerospace Engineering at TU Delft University</b> in the Netherlands.
            I am specialising in Control theory and Simulation.
            I completed my bachelor in Aerospace engineering and a Minor in Computer Science with a specialization track in Artificial Intelligence & Big Data, and worked as a simulation engineer at the Delft Aerospace Rocket Engineering (DARE) dream team.</p>
            <br/>
            I was exposed to a particularly international environment early on, starting in Paris (France), where I was born, to successively Doha (Qatar), Casablanca (Morocco), Dubai (United Arab Emirates) and finally Delft (Netherlands).
            This constant exposure to new contexts and mindsets, along with me studying in two different educational systems (the French system and the IB) gave me the chance to greatly foster a curious nature and an open-minded attitude.
            It also gave me the opportunity to learn to approach, analyze, and ultimately solve complex problems in an effective and organized way.</p>
            <br/>
            In addition to that, I spent a significant amount of time gaining experience in a number of various fields, including academic work (e.g. scientific papers, minor studies), and practical experience (e.g. design exercises, personal programming projects) in the fields of machine learning, artificial intelligence, computer science, and (big) data analysis.
            I also spend my free time developing skills in my personal interests, with fields such as economics, new technologies (e.g. blockchain, and cryptocurrency) through reading, and trading as a hobby).</p>
            <br/>
            <i>Being curious in nature, I am looking forward to pushing forward research, development, and ultimately progress through an atypical background combining my knowledge of Aerospace Engineering, the power of Computer Science, and an overall curiosity for what the future holds.</i></p>
